# INFR3120-Fall25-Project
The topic that we chose as group 29 is a web-based Fleet Operations Tracker designed to help organizations have a clear, real-time view of their entire vehicle fleet. Instead of relying on scattered notes, manuel logs, or outdated spreadsheets, our system centralizes everything, from vehicle status, upcoming maintenance, fuel usage, driver assignments, and route information.With just a few clicks, users can check whether a truck is on the road, due for service, or experiencing an issue. This helps reduce downtime, extend vehicle lifespan, and keep operations running smoothly. We built our website to be simple and understandable, so even new staff can quickly understand how to use it.

To ensure a smooth user experience, the Fleet Operations system's initial release will feature an  intuitive Landing Page that displays our team's unique logo and site name. This page will immediately offer a "View Fleet Status" hero button, for creating an appropriate object. Making everything organized in one place, ensuring that important tasks are never forgotten. By automating the messy parts of fleet management, the system helps companies save time, reduce costs, and operate with more confidence and control.

While authentication is not required at this stage of development , the design prioritizes easy navigation to allow users to fully perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their incident reports through a simple, functional interface, ensuring the core application logic is solid before moving to advanced features. This foundational interface will be deployed and accessible via a chosen cloud service provider, representing the first complete functional release of the Web Application.
